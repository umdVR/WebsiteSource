description: The VR Club is kicking the semester off with a welcome back class on the Unity game engine! Unity is one of most commonly used game engines for VR content and is an invaluable piece of software to learn if you intend on making VR projects of your own. The class will be held in the VR Lab, AVW room 4176 (room may change; see [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/UMDVRClub/) for more details), every Friday. Hope to see you guys there!
